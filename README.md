# Hey there, I’m Lawrence 👋🏾  

Data whisperer. Systems thinker. Recovering from “Can you pull me that report real quick?” syndrome.  

🎓 Currently wrangling data as an **Enrollment Data Program Manager** at **Florida Polytechnic University**, where I’ve built full-blown Python pipelines to track, forecast, and predict enrollment — turning Salesforce chaos into Power BI clarity and machine-learning insight.  

💡 I’m passionate about:
- Turning human stories into data-driven action  
- Building sustainable systems that make institutions smarter, not just faster  
- Using analytics to make education, energy, and business more people-centered  
- And occasionally, finding ways to make a dashboard… *cute.*
